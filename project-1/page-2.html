    <h1>Double Chocolate Sourdough Bread - A Fermented Treat</h1>
    <br>
    <p>You all know that I love to add fermented foods to our diet any chance I can get so it felt great to find a fermented treat that wasnâ€™t overly sweet, but still satisfies when a sweet craving arises. The fermentation process breaks down the phytic acid to help make the bread easier to digest as well as increasing the amount of nutrients available for absorption. </p>
