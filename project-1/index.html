    <h1>Double Chocolate Sourdough Bread Recipe</h1>
    <p>Double chocolate sourdough chocolate bread is a fun twist on a tried and true staple. Combing two favorites, sourdough and chocolate, you can’t go wrong! You’ll love this soft, chewy sourdough bread made with cocoa powder along with bursts of chocolatey goodness from the added chocolate chips. This indulgent bread has all of the flavor of chocolate cake but with the benefits of fermented sourdough bread.</p>
    <p>The first time I made this bread I only used cocoa powder and it was good, but I knew I wanted more chocolate flavor. So I added chocolate chips and it was perfect!  The chocolate chips brings just the right amount of sweetness and that rich chocolate flavor that I was hoping for.</p>
