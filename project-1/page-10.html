    <h1>Example Baking Schedule</h1>
    <p>This chocolate sourdough bread recipe couldn’t be easier, but sometimes it’s nice to have a sample timeline, especially as you learn to work with sourdough breads. This is a typical schedule for the winter months when the house is cooler. During the summer months, I will bump the first day back two more hours so that the bulk ferment isn’t as long.</p>
    <h3>Day 1:</h3>
    <p><b>10 am</b> Remove the starter from the refrigerator and feed ratio of 1:1:1, starter, flour and water.</p>
    <p><b>6-8 pm</b> Mix the dough and do the series of stretch and folds.</p>
    <p><b>8 pm</b> Allow to bulk ferment overnight at room temperature.</p>
    <h3>Day 2:</h3>
    <p><b>8 am</b> Shape the dough and place into the refrigerator for the second rise.</p>
    <p><b>1 pm</b> Preheat Dutch oven.</p>
    <p><b>2 pm</b> Bake bread.</p>
