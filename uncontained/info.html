    <p class="info-text">
      This project explores the <b>cycle of accessibility and neglect</b> within New York City’s <br>public infrastructure by focusing on something as essential and human as the need for restrooms.
      <br>Through data visualization, it highlights how public spaces are designed, maintained, and forgotten.

      <h2>Data Ethics & Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provenance: All datasets originate from official NYC Open Data sources maintained by city agencies.</li>
        <li>Representativeness: Data reflects city-managed facilities and monitored intersections only. Private or unrecorded spaces are not included.</li>
        <li>Known Bias / Limits: Restroom dataset may exclude temporarily closed or unlisted facilities. Pedestrian data is from limited sensors.</li>
        <li>Sensitive Fields: No personal identifying information (PII) was used. All data are aggregated and public.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="info-reflection">
      Urban data often reveals what’s <i>missing</i> as much as what’s measured.  
      By mapping restrooms  <br>and foot traffic, this project visualizes how <b>public needs</b> are both seen and unseen,<br> asking how infrastructure can evolve to meet the rhythms of real city life.
