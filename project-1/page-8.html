    <h1>Score and Bake</h1>
    <p>Preheat the Dutch oven to 400 degrees for 45 minutes.</p>
    <p>Lightly dust the top of the loaf with flour. Using a bread lame or sharp knife, score the top of the dough, giving the bread a place to expand as it bakes. Lift the bread using the parchment paper into the Dutch oven, quickly replacing the lid and back into the oven. Bake for 40 minutes with the lid on. When the time is up, remove the lid and bake for an additional 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>When the time is up, remove the bread from the oven and place it on a wire cooling rack. The chocolate makes it difficult to know if the bread is done so I like to use a digital thermometer to double-check. You know itâ€™s done when it reaches 200 degrees.</p>
    <p>Wait until the bread cools completely before slicing.</p>
