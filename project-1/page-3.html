    <h1>Ingredients and Equipment for Double Chocolate Sourdough Bread</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Active sourdough starter 100 g </b>– You will need an active starter for this bread recipe.</li>
        <li><b>Bread Flour 475 g</b> – Since cocoa powder tends to inhibit gluten development using bread flour, which has a higher protein content, helps the bread to have the proper structure to have a nice rise. Using all-purpose flour will work too but the bread may be a bit flatter.</li>
        <li><b>Cocoa powder 50 g </b>– Use unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
        <li><b>Warm water 350 g</b> – Using warm water creates the best environment for the bread to rise.</li>
        <li><b>Brown sugar 50 g</b> – Adds just a touch of sweetness but also helps the bread to be soft and chewy.</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b> – Adds flavor to baked goods.</li>
        <li><b>Dark chocolate chips 1 cup</b> – Dark chocolate adds chocolate flavor without being overly sweet but would be delicious with milk chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate chips. For an extra chocolatey flavor chop up a chocolate bar and add to the bread.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
